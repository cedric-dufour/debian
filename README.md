Debian Packaging resources
==========================

A bunch of `*.debian.tar.xz` tarballs to (re-)package software that one needs.

Note that the `*.orig.tar.*` tarballs are _not_ included and _must_ be downloaded from each
software's official download source.

See the [pbuilder-easy](https://github.com/cedric-dufour/scriptisms/blob/master/system/pbuilder-easy)
script for a not-too-painful experience in creating Debian packages.

Debian Rocks!
